<div class="blurb">
<p>Hi, I'm Kevin. Husband to an amazingly dedicated and caring wife and Father to two amazing, funny, talented kids that are growing up way to darn fast.</p>

<p>I started this site because I've been journaling for 5+ years now and am interested in writing a little bit more, possibly in longer form. Also just to try something new and get out of this rut (mid-life crisis?). I also like to learn about technology so learning some html, css, markdown sounded interesting.</p>

<p>Lately I'm interested in:
<ul>
  <li>Stoicism</li>
  <li>Minimalism</li>
  <li>Meditation</li>
  <li>Behavioral Finance</li>
  <li>Being Outside, in Nature</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Favorite Things
<ul>
  <li>Drink - Cold Brew iced coffee</li>
  <li>Reading - mostly Non-Fiction</li>
  <li>Movie - <a href="https://movies.disney.com/up">Up</a></li>
  <li>Song - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oho-q53uiv4">In a Week, Hozier</a></li>
  <li>Mountains > Beaches</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I journal in a modified <a href="https://www.bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a> style in a Leuchtturm 1917 (A5 softcover dot grid) using a Pentel Energel 0.7mm pen, if you're into that sorta thing.
</p>
<p>I'm on a mission to visit all <a href="https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm">59 US National Parks</a>, and to a lesser extent all 50 states.</p>
